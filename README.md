My message to recruiter :

I wish to highlight a challenge I faced during this process. The initial 24 hours presented unforeseen tasks that required immediate attention, leaving me with limited time to dedicate to the project. Regrettably, due to this time constraint, I was unable to allocate sufficient time for writing unit tests. However, I maximized efficiency by leveraging previously built components where applicable, allowing me to make the most of the available time and deliver a polished product.

I appreciate your understanding regarding this matter. Despite the time constraints, I am proud of the outcome achieved and believe it reflects my dedication and proficiency in Flutter development.

Please don't hesitate to reach out should you have any questions or require further clarification regarding the project submission. I welcome the opportunity to discuss my work in more detail and explore how I can contribute to your team.

Thank you for considering my application and for your understanding of the challenges encountered during this process. I eagerly anticipate the possibility of further discussions regarding potential collaboration.

## Getting Started
This project utilizes the Bloc state management pattern to manage the application's state efficiently. Bloc provides a clear separation between the UI and business logic, resulting in a more maintainable and scalable codebase. By leveraging Bloc, we ensure robust state management throughout the application, enhancing its stability and performance.
